                ```
                #include <iostream>
                #include <vector>

                using namespace std;

                // Inefficient code for finding duplicates in a vector of user IDs

                                duplicates.push_back(userIds[i]);
                            }
                        }

                Example of Analysis:
                Analysis and reasoning example:
                    - Reduction of Nested Loops: Uses an O(nÂ²) approach with nested loops.
                    - Efficient Data Structure Selection: Using an unordered_set to track seen user IDs reduces complexity to O(n).
                    - Dynamic Programming or Memoization: Not required here as each ID is processed once with an efficient data structure.
                    - Specialized Algorithms: Using hashing-based data structures effectively reduces redundant checks.
                    - I/O Optimization: Minimal I/O operations are used. Keep output operations efficient and straightforward.
                    - Code Simplicity and Readability: The optimized approach using unordered_set is both efficient and easy to understand.

} Here's some suggestion on how you should optimize the code from the evaluator, keep these in mind when optimizing code
To optimize the given code snippet for better energy efficiency and performance, let's break down the requirements and analyze possible improvements.

### 1. Current Code Behavior

The purpose of the code is to generate binary trees of varying depths using an APR-based memory pool for memory management, and then perform checks on each tree to ensure correctness. It leverages parallel processing with OpenMP to handle multiple depths concurrently.

- **Design**: Uses APR for memory management with `NodePool` acting as a wrapper for efficient memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Algorithm**: It builds complete binary trees recursively. The depth and number of iterations depend on user input or default settings.
- **Assumptions**: The code assumes that APR is available and correctly initializes and terminates it. It uses a consistent depth increment pattern for parallel processing.

### 2. Inefficiencies and Bottlenecks

- **Time Complexity**: The `make` function has exponential time complexity \( O(2^d) \), as it builds a binary tree of depth \( d \), constructing all tree nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: Scales based on the depth of the tree, but efficiently managed by memory pools. Temporary allocations are frequent.
- **Readability**: Generally clear, but improvements can be made to concise variable usage and avoid magic numbers such as `LINE_SIZE`.
- **Energy Consumption**: High due to:
  - Recursive tree construction and frequent memory pool operations.
  - Inefficient string concatenation and memory usage for storing output.

### 3. Energy-Efficiency Specific Analysis

- **Memory Allocations**: Contained but numerous due to recursive allocations.
- **Disk I/O**: Output operations (using `printf` and `std::cout`) add overhead, especially in parallel sections.
- **Loops**: Parallelized but could benefit from additional optimization like chunk scheduling in OpenMP.

### 4. Comparison to Best Optimized Code

The current code uses standard constructs for efficiency but could benefit further with specific optimizations:

- **Data Structures**: Already optimal with `NodePool`.
- **Parallelization**: Employ OpenMP for concurrency but could enhance with task-based parallelism or adjust scheduling.
- **String Management**: Uses `std::string` instead of raw allocations, improving safety but potentially affecting performance with frequent operations.

### 5. Improvement Suggestions

#### Refactor for Optimized Memory Usage

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Use stack allocation for small structures if feasible to reduce heap overhead.
   
2. **Parallel Execution**:
   - Adjust OpenMP pragmas to enhance parallel efficiency (e.g., `#pragma omp for schedule(dynamic)`).

3. **Output Management**:
   - Use thread-safe buffers or combine outputs more efficiently post-calculation to limit `printf` operations.

#### Code Optimization Steps:

1. Change OpenMP scheduling:
    ```cpp
    #pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)
    for (int d = min_depth; d <= max_depth; d += 2) { ... }
    ```

2. Combine outputs after parallel region:
   - Accumulate results in memory and perform a single output operation post-parallel computation.

3. Inline small functions where applicable to reduce call overhead.

### 6. Energy-Specific Metrics and Best Practices

- **Avoid Frequent Allocations**: Use manual memory management wisely; avoid unnecessary clears if persistent data could suffice.
- **Cache Efficiency**: Align frequently accessed data structures like `Node` for better cache performance.
- **Reduce I/O**: Update logging to use minimal I/O or buffer large batches before printing.

    }
    return root;
}

    Apr apr;
    int min_depth = 4;
    int max_depth = std::max(min_depth + 2, (argc == 2 ? atoi(argv[1]) : 10));
    int stretch_depth = max_depth + 1;

    // Alloc then dealloc stretchdepth tree
    {

        int c = 0;
        NodePool store;
        for (int i = 1; i <= iterations; ++i) {
            Node* a = make(d, store);
            c += a->check();
            store.clear();
        }
        std::string result = std::to_string(iterations) + "\t trees of depth " +
                             std::to_string(d) + "\t check: " + std::to_string(c) + "\n";
        results[d / 2] = result;
    }

    for (const auto& result : results) {
        printf("%s", result.c_str());
    }

    std::cout << "long-lived tree of depth " << max_depth << "\t "
              << "check: " << long_lived_tree->check() << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This modified code should result in a better runtime and energy efficiency by optimizing memory usage, reducing I/O operations, and enhancing parallel computation efficiency.
