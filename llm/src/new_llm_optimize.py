prompt = """You are tasked with optimizing the following C++ code to improve its energy efficiency. This involves reducing CPU cycles, minimizing memory access, and optimizing I/O operations. Please follow these steps and guidelines:

 Task Instructions:

                - Analyze the code: Examine the provided C++ code in detail.
                - Identify optimization opportunities, determine where you can:
                    - Reduce or eliminate nested loops to lower computational overhead.
                    - Select more efficient data structures to minimize memory access and improve performance.
                    - Apply dynamic programming or memoization to avoid redundant calculations and reduce CPU usage where applicable.
                    - Implement specialized algorithms if they can significantly improve performance and reduce energy consumption.
                    - Optimize I/O operations to reduce their impact on overall performance.
                - Suggest optimization strategies: Propose multiple methods to improve energy efficiency. For each method:
                    - Provide a detailed explanation of how the optimization reduces energy usage.
                    - Discuss the trade-offs in terms of complexity, maintainability, and performance gains.
                - Choose the most effective optimization: After evaluating each proposed strategy, select the approach that yields the best balance of energy efficiency, performance, readability, and maintainability.
                - Implement the chosen optimization: Rewrite the code with the chosen optimization strategies, ensuring:
                    - The optimized code produces the same output as the original code for all valid inputs.
                    - Code remains clear and understandable.
                - Provide a detailed explanation: For each change you make, explain:
                    - Why this change optimizes energy efficiency.
                    - The improvement in performance and energy usage expected.
                    - How this change preserves the correctness and format of the output.
                - Output Requirements:
                    - Begin with a step-by-step analysis of the original code and identify inefficiencies.
                    - Outline each proposed optimization strategy in detail, including the reasoning behind it and its potential impact on energy usage.
                    - Implement the best optimization strategies directly into the code.
                    - Ensure the final code is energy-efficient, correct in terms of functionality, and maintains similar output formatting.
                                
                Here is an example of desirable response:
                Example of cpp code to be optimized:
                ```
                #include <iostream>
                #include <vector>

                using namespace std;

                // Inefficient code for finding duplicates in a vector of user IDs
                vector<int> findDuplicates(const vector<int>& userIds) {
                    vector<int> duplicates;
                    for (size_t i = 0; i < userIds.size(); ++i) {
                        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < userIds.size(); ++j) {
                            if (userIds[i] == userIds[j]) {
                                duplicates.push_back(userIds[i]);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    return duplicates;
                }

                int main() {
                    vector<int> userIds = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5};
                    vector<int> duplicates = findDuplicates(userIds);

                    cout << "Duplicate user IDs: ";
                    for (int id : duplicates) {
                        cout << id << " ";
                    }
                    cout << endl;

                    return 0;
                }
                ```
                Example of Analysis:
                Analysis and reasoning example:
                    - Reduction of Nested Loops: Uses an O(nÂ²) approach with nested loops.
                    - Efficient Data Structure Selection: Using an unordered_set to track seen user IDs reduces complexity to O(n).
                    - Dynamic Programming or Memoization: Not required here as each ID is processed once with an efficient data structure.
                    - Specialized Algorithms: Using hashing-based data structures effectively reduces redundant checks.
                    - I/O Optimization: Minimal I/O operations are used. Keep output operations efficient and straightforward.
                    - Code Simplicity and Readability: The optimized approach using unordered_set is both efficient and easy to understand.
                
                Here is the actual optimized code: 
                ```
                #include <iostream>
                #include <vector>
                #include <unordered_set>

                using namespace std;

                // Optimized code for finding duplicates in a vector of user IDs
                vector<int> findDuplicates(const vector<int>& userIds) {
                    unordered_set<int> seen;  // Set to track seen user IDs
                    unordered_set<int> duplicates;  // Set to store duplicates
                    for (int id : userIds) {
                        if (seen.find(id) != seen.end()) {
                            duplicates.insert(id);  // Add to duplicates if already seen
                        } else {
                            seen.insert(id);  // Mark as seen
                        }
                    }
                    return vector<int>(duplicates.begin(), duplicates.end());  // Convert set to vector
                }

                int main() {
                    vector<int> userIds = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5};
                    vector<int> duplicates = findDuplicates(userIds);

                    cout << "Duplicate user IDs: ";
                    for (int id : duplicates) {
                        cout << id << " ";

                    return 0;
